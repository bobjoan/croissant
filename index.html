        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, crescent-shaped pastry of Austrian
        origin, oftn eaten for breakfast or as a snack. It is made from a
        leavened dough that is layered with butter, rolled and folded multiple
        times to create a delicate, airy texture.
        <br />
        Croissants are typically golden brown on the outside and have soft,
        tender interior, with a rich and slightly sweet flavor.
